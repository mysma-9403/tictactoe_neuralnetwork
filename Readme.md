# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Neural Network and Minimax

## Description

This project implements an artificial intelligence for the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm and a simple neural network for decision-making.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: A recursive algorithm that evaluates the best possible move.
- **Neural Network**: Learns from saved training data to improve its decisions.
- **Training Data Storage**: AI saves played games to `training_data.json` to enhance its gameplay.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can play against the AI.

## Mathematical Background

### Minimax Algorithm
Minimax is a decision rule used in game theory to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. It operates by simulating all possible game states and selecting the move that minimizes the opponentâ€™s best possible outcome.

Mathematically, the Minimax function is defined as:

```math
V(s) =
\begin{cases}
  \max_{a \in A(s)} V(\text{result}(s, a)) & \text{if player is maximizing} \\
  \min_{a \in A(s)} V(\text{result}(s, a)) & \text{if player is minimizing}
\end{cases}
```

where:
- \(V(s)\) is the value of a state \(s\),
- \(A(s)\) is the set of possible actions in state \(s\),
- \(\text{result}(s, a)\) is the new state after taking action \(a\).

### Neural Network
The neural network used in this project consists of two fully connected layers. The activation function used is the hyperbolic tangent function:

```math
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
```

which ensures non-linearity and maps the input values into a range between \(-1,1\). The weights of the network are updated using backpropagation with gradient descent:

```math
W_{\text{new}} = W_{\text{old}} - \alpha \frac{\partial E}{\partial W}
```

where:
- \(\alpha\) is the learning rate,
- \(E\) is the error function,
- \(W\) are the network weights.

### Game State Representation
The Tic-Tac-Toe board is represented as a vector of length 9:

```math
\text{board} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_9]
```

where:
- \(x_i = 1\) if occupied by the player,
- \(x_i = -1\) if occupied by the AI,
- \(x_i = 0\) if empty.

This representation allows the neural network to learn optimal strategies based on past game data.
